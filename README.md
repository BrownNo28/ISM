# Topsegi

Topsegi is a Python package developed to calculate the temperature (T) and column density (N) of molecules and their isotopologues observed in interstellar environments, such as planetary atmospheres, satellites, comets, carbon-rich stars, and the Orion IRc2 region. This package utilizes high-resolution infrared spectral data from instruments like SOFIA to accurately analyze molecular properties. Unlike traditional rotational diagram methods, which calculate T and N separately, this study introduces a quadtree-based optimization algorithm to estimate both variables simultaneously. This approach improves accuracy while reducing computational costs. Additionally, Topsegi is designed to supplement rotational and vibrational constants of isotopologues not available in the HITRAN database using Density Functional Theory (B3LYP) calculations. This Python package will be a valuable tool for quantitative analysis of interstellar molecules and is expected to be widely used in future high-resolution spectroscopic studies.

Note : The currently available version is not the full release but a Code Release.
